# ChaosOS_Skill_Remix
 A personal update to 5e's skill system


## New Skills

### Appeal

Your Charisma (Appeal) check allows you to influence the behavior and mindset of others by swaying their emotions. You might do this through metaphors and stories, making a personal connection, or through impassioned words and actions.

### Debate

Your Intelligence (Debate) check allows you to influence the behavior and mindset of others through making logical arguments. Doing so requires identifying shared assumptions and deriving a path to the desired conclusion.

### Impress

Your Charisma (Impress) check allows you to influence the behavior and mindset of others through establishing a strength of character. Impressing someone requires forging a bond of trust that you are who you say you are and that you will carry out the actions that you promise to. For example, you might convince a town that they can wait for you, get a noble to buy your disguise and cover story, or even scare a group of bandits into believing that you will return if they don't fix their behavior.
